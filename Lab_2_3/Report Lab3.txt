1. Look at the differences between the default model and the attributes
found with hyperparameters search. How do the two models differ?

Major differences between the default model and the hyperparameters model:
    - EPOCHS: 5 vs 100
    - Learning Rate: 0.1 vs 0.04

2. Using the tuned model, take at least 2 wrongly classified
examples from the test set, and try explaining why the model failed.

    ('i love scifi and am willing to put up with a lot scifi moviestv are usually underfunded underappreciated and misunderstood i 
tried to like this i really did but it is to good tv scifi as babylon 5 is to star trek the original silly prosthetics cheap cardboard 
sets stilted dialogues cg that doesnt match the background and painfully onedimensional characters cannot be overcome with a scifi setting 
im sure there are those of you out there who think babylon 5 is good scifi tv its not its clich√©d and uninspiring while us viewers might 
like emotion and character development scifi is a genre that does not take itself seriously cf star trek it may treat important issues yet
not as a serious philosophy its really difficult to care about the characters here as they are not simply foolish just missing a spark of 
life their actions and reactions are wooden and predictable often painful to watch the makers of earth know its rubbish as they have to always
say gene roddenberrys earth otherwise people would not continue watching roddenberrys ashes must be turning in their orbit as this dull cheap
poorly edited watching it without advert breaks really brings this home trudging trabant of a show lumbers into space spoiler so kill off a 
main character and then bring him back as another actor jeeez dallas all over again', 0),
  
   ('worth the entertainment value of a rental especially if you like action movies this one features the usual car chases fights with the great
van damme kick style shooting battles with the 40 shell load shotgun and even terrorist style bombs all of this is entertaining and competently
handled but there is nothing that really blows you away if youve seen your share beforebr br the plot is made interesting by the inclusion of
a rabbit which is clever but hardly profound many of the characters are heavily stereotyped  the angry veterans the terrified illegal aliens
the crooked cops the indifferent feds the bitchy tough lady station head the crooked politician the fat federale who looks like he was typecast
as the mexican in a hollywood movie from the 1940s all passably acted but again nothing specialbr br i thought the main villains were pretty 
well done and fairly well acted by the end of the movie you certainly knew who the good guys were and werent there was an emotional lift as 
the really bad ones got their just deserts very simplistic but then you werent expecting hamlet right the only thing i found really annoying was
the constant cuts to vds daughter during the last fight scenebr br not bad not good passable 4', 0)

In both cases, the arguments are qualified and there are parts with words that the model can classified
in the wrong label. Due to the complexity inside the argument, the model maybe just doesn't
