This folder contains the work for the **Lab 2 and the Lab 3**.

For these two projects, we have an introduction to NLP using an IMDN dataset. In the first place, we create a Naives Bayes Classifier
with Sklearn. After that, we use the library Fasttext to create models and in the same way, we explore, try and test on the IMDB dataset.

Also, we have an introduciton to the importance of the pre-processing step on the data and on what is the **steming** and the **lemmatization**.

We have 3 files such as:
- **Notebook_Lab_2_3**: source code
- **Report_Lab_2**: the report associated to the questions of the Lab 2
- **Report_Lab_3**: the report associated to the questions of the Lab 3
